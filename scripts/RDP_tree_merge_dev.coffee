# This script reads in one or more JSON formatted heirarchy files and merges
# them into to a new unified JSON tree formatted output file.
#
# Inputs: JSON formatted heirarchy files in the global variable input_files.
#
# Output: output JSON formatted heirarchy to stdout
#
# Output file format:
# Each taxonomic unit in the RDP input file becomes a branch in the output JSON tree.
# Each branch has the following JSON structure:
#
# name : {
#      "pop" : <fraction of the sample>,
#      "cum" : <cumulative fraction of the sample>,
#      "num" : <number of sequences>,
#      "cnt" : <cumulative number of seqeunces>,
#      "conf" : <mean classifier p-value for sequences in this taxon>,
#      "w_conf" : <population weighted mean classifier p-value for sequences in this taxon>,
#      "level" : <numeric level in heirarchy>,
#      "length" : <branch length of this taxonomic level from parent>
#      "samples" : <sample child nodes containing pop, cum, num, cnt and conf>
#      "sub" : {<child nodes by name, or empty if a leaf>}
# }
